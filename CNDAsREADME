# CNDA - CUI-Neural-net-Discovery-Approximator

Pronounced 'Canada' - A neural network that takes SemRep relationships to predict new CUI relationships. 

## Getting Started

Download CNDA.py and the data folder. Keep the file and the folder in the same directory

### Prerequisites

#### Libraries
* [Python 3.4.3 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Numpy and Scipy](https://scipy.org/install.html)
* [Tensorflow 1.3.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)
* [Keras 2.0.9](https://keras.io/#installation)

#### Local files
* CNDA.py
* Data files named in the form 'cui_[name]' in the 'data/' directory
```
data/cui_predicates1985-1987
```
* Data contents in the form _CUI	PREDICATE	CUI1	CUI2	CUI3...CUIN_ (tab separated)

```
C002	TREATS	C005	C006	C010
```

## Running

#### Default

Running ```python3 CNDA.py``` just runs the 'cui_sanity' data file to test the neural network functionality

#### Parameters

* Data File - the data set to use found under 'data/' directory
* Input test CUI - the input CUI to test for similarity
* Output test CUI - the output CUI to test for its rank within the predictions for the CUI input
* (optional) Batch size - the size of the batches to break the data sets into

#### Example command
```
python3 CNDA.py cui_mini C003 C002 3
```

## Output

#### Console

The program outputs the following to the console: 

* Weight ratio (GCF 0:1 in the one-hot vector)
* Base loss, accuracy, precision, and recall
* Trained loss, accuracy, precision, and recall / epoch
* Time to Train (seconds)
* Ranks for Test Input Cui vs. Test Output Cui relative to the rest of the cuis


#### Local Files

The program outputs the following to local files in the same directory of CNDA.py:

* data/[filename]_CUI_KEY - key indexes for the cuis used in the data set
* predict_data/[filename] - prediction data directory for the data set used 
* predict_data/[filename]/sorted/ - sorted predictions directory
* predicate prediction files - predictions for every predicate found in the data set (in the form '[filename]_[PREDICATE]') under predict_data/ and sorted/
